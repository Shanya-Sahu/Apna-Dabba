              We have created this website for the purpose of opening tiffin
              service in the university campus main for the hostelors and
              teachers, working Stuff and any kind of people who want to get
              tiffin and converting it into an online platform. Our website
              removes the problem of offline management by bringing Tiffin
              Management System online platform. This website is user friendly
              for both the owner and the customers. And because of this, the
              problems that existed in offline management are getting removed.
              With this, both the order data and the customer details of the
              customers are protected and the customer also gets access to view
              his data using user I'd and password. Due to this it becomes very
              easy for the owner to manage the tiffin service.
